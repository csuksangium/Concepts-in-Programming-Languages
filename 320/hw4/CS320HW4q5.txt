Question 5B
Superstring produces lists as short as when greedy bestPair is called (ratio for 3 test cases = 1). greedy bestWithFirst prints a slightly longer string compared to
superstring (ration superstring to bestWithFirst is 0.75). firstPair produces the longest result where ratio of superstring to firstPair is 0.65. On the otherhand, the four
greedy algorithms managed to generate results much faster than superstring thus calling greedy with bestPair would result in fastest way to generate shortest string in the 
fastest time.
